    Args:
        x
            Input signal(s). For a higher dimensional array, the pitch is detected along the last
            dimension.

        fs
            Input signal sampling rate in Samples/second. This must
            match model.fs.

        model
            Pitch detection deep-learning model.

        hop
            The increment in signal samples, by which the window
            is shifted in each step for frame-wise processing. If None, hop
            is set to (roughly) 10 ms for CREPE models and 'native' for FCN-F0 models

        harmonic_threshold
            Harmonic detection threshold on the classifier confidence level. If confidence level
            is below this threshold, f0=0 is returned, indicating the frame has no harmonic
            content.

        postprocessor
            Specify to enable the dynamic programming postprocessor to select the frequency transitions

        postprocessor_kws
            Specify the options for the postprocessor.

        hop
            The increment in signal samples, by which the window
            is shifted in each step for frame-wise processing. If None, hop
            size of (roughly) 10 ms is used. For stream processing, this argument
            is ignored and the native hop size (self.native_hop) of the model
            is used instead.

        p0
            The first element of the range of slices to calculate.
            If None then it is set to p_min, which is the smallest possible
            slice.

        p1
            The end of the array. If None then the largest
            possible slice is used.

        k_offset
            Index of first sample (t = 0) in x.

        padding
            Kind of values which are added, when the sliding window sticks out on
            either the lower or upper end of the input x. Zeros are added if the default ‘zeros’
            is set. For ‘edge’ either the first or the last value of x is used. ‘even’ pads by
            reflecting the signal on the first or last sample and ‘odd’ additionally multiplies
            it with -1.

        batch_size
            Number of samples per batch.
            If unspecified, `batch_size` will default to 32.
            Do not specify the `batch_size` if your data is in the
            form of dataset, generators, or `keras.utils.PyDataset`
            instances (since they generate batches).

        verbose
            `"auto"`, 0, 1, or 2. Verbosity mode.
            0 = silent, 1 = progress bar, 2 = single line.
            `"auto"` becomes 1 for most cases. Note that the progress bar
            is not particularly useful when logged to a file,
            so `verbose=2` is recommended when not running interactively
            (e.g. in a production environment). Defaults to `"auto"`.

        steps
            Total number of steps (batches of samples)
            before declaring the prediction round finished.
            Ignored with the default value of `None`.
            If `x` is a `tf.data.Dataset` and `steps` is `None`,
            `predict()` will run until the input dataset is exhausted.

        callbacks
            List of `keras.callbacks.Callback` instances.
            List of callbacks to apply during prediction.

    :Returns:
        If postprocessor is assigned:
